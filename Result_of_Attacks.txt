Without any voice attacks, the 1-th transcription is AROUND CHRISTMAS IN MY HOME IN TENNESSEE A BILLION GALLONS OF COAL SLUDGE WAS SPILLED YOU PROBABLY SAW IT ON THE NEWS THIS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY IS THE SECOND LARGEST WASTE STREAM IN AMERICA THIS HAPPENED AROUND CHRISTMAS ONE OF THE COAL INDUSTRY 'S ADS AROUND CHRISTMAS WAS THIS ONE
The current adversarial attack is CW_ASR_Attack, the 1-th target is HEY ALEXA CLOSE
After adding the attack CW_ASR_Attack, the 1-th adversarial sample transcripted by Deepspeech is: ALSE

After 2 epochs, the final result shows as follows
at_wer_list is [0.8 1. ]
ao_wer_list is [1. 1.]
The max wer value between adversarial example and adversarial target is  1.0
The max wer location between adv and target is  (array([1]),)
The average wer value between adv and target is  0.9
The max wer value between adversarial example and original context is  1.0

Note:
The speed of generating the adversarial samples is not shown here, i.e., CW ASR Attack generates the adversarial examples faster than the IMP ASR Attack, however, as you can see, the performance of CW Attack is worse than the IMP's. There is always a trade-off between the performance and generating speed of the adversarial examples.
