1, python Attack_WER.py --attack CW_ASR_Attack --defense Gaussian

Without any voice attacks, the 0-th transcription is LOOK CAREFULLY AT THE AREA OF THE EASTERN PACIFIC FROM THE AMERICAS EXTENDING WESTWARD AND ON EITHER SIDE OF THE INDIAN SUBCONTINENT WHERE THERE IS A RADICAL DEPLETION OF OXYGEN IN THE OCEANS
The current adversarial attack is CW_ASR_Attack, the 0-th target is HEY SIRI PASTE PRIVATE INFORMATION
After adding the defense Gaussian ,the 0-th adversarial sample transcripted by Deepspeech is: WHY SI PRIVATE INFORION

Without any voice attacks, the 1-th transcription is AROUND CHRISTMAS IN MY HOME IN TENNESSEE A BILLION GALLONS OF COAL SLUDGE WAS SPILLED YOU PROBABLY SAW IT ON THE NEWS THIS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY IS THE SECOND LARGEST WASTE STREAM IN AMERICA THIS HAPPENED AROUND CHRISTMAS ONE OF THE COAL INDUSTRY 'S ADS AROUND CHRISTMAS WAS THIS ONE
The current adversarial attack is CW_ASR_Attack, the 1-th target is HEY ALEXA CLOSE
After adding the defense Gaussian ,the 1-th adversarial sample transcripted by Deepspeech is: ALSE

After 2 epochs, the final result shows as follows
at_wer_list is [0.8 1. ]
ao_wer_list is [1. 1.]
The max wer value between adversarial example and adversarial target is  1.0
The max wer location between adv and target is  (array([1]),)
The average wer value between adv and target is  0.9
The max wer value between adversarial example and original context is  1.0

Note:
Please compare the above results with the results in the previous file Result_of_Attack, you can find that the above three defenses do not work, you can also try different parameters to adjust the peformance of defenses. In any case, the above defense will not be effective.
